Code for poster presented at JSM: "Creating Custom Take Home Exams for Statistics Courses with R Markdown"

### JSM Poster

On July 30, 2018, I presented a poster on creating custom take home exams for a statistics class using R Markdown. It includes the .Rmd file as well as the bash script I use to create the individual exams.  You need to have `pdftk` installed to split the pdf files.  If using something other than Linux, you might need another application to split the pdf files.
